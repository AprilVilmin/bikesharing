# Bikesharing with Tableau

## Overview of the Analysis/Statistical Analysis
After a trip to New York City with Kate, a friend of yours, the two of you came up with an idea to came up with the idea of starting a bikesharing program in Des Moines. This program/company will be based on the Citi Bike program you used in New York City. Kate found someone who may be interested in investing money in your idea. Kate is going to pitch the program to the investor(s), while you are going to focus on preparing the presentation and working with the data. You have decided to use Tableau Public as the presentation tool and public Citi Bike data to do your analysis. You decided to look at this data in multiple ways including: by trip duration, by gender, by usertype, by age and by location. 

## Results
Below are several visualizations made from the public Citi Bike data. ![Link to Story](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/april.vilmin/viz/Challenge_16497262684860/ChallengeStory?publish=yes)


### Checkout Times for Users

#### This graph shows that bikes are most frequently checked out in increments of less than an hour at a time. This makes sense as some of the other graphics illustrate that the highest periods of usage are during weekday commutes.

### Checkout Times by Gender

#### This graph illustrates that men not only check out bikes for longer periods of time then women and those of unknown gender/sex, but they also ride for longer periods of time.

### Trips by Weekday per Hour
![Trips by Weekday per Hour.png](https://github.com/AprilVilmin/bikesharing/blob/main/Trips%20by%20Weekday%20per%20Hour.png)

#### This heatmap shows high usage during the morning and evening commutes. It also shows high usages on Saturday. The higher the usage the darker the color on the map. The hours of 12 AM to 4 AM show the least amount of usage.

### Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)

#### This heatmap makes the difference in bike usage by gender/sex even more striking, as it shows males in much deeper hues than females or unknowns meaning much greater usage. This holds true for rush hours and weekends. This would help Kate and the investors determine who the potential audience is and what the best time to market to them is.

### Trips by Gender by Weekday
![Trips by Gender by Weekday.png](https://github.com/AprilVilmin/bikesharing/blob/main/User%20Trips%20by%20Gender%20by%20Weekday.png)

#### This heatmap shows a variety of things. First it shows that there are more annual subscribers than pay as they go users. Meaning that the bikes are utilized more by locals that tourists. Second, it confirms that males utilize the bikes more than females or those whose gender/sex is unknown. Third, There are more male subscribers than female or subscribers of unknown gender/sex. Fourth, Thursday appears to be the heaviest day of usage for subscribers. These subscribers happen to be male. Saturday and Sundays appear to be the heaviest days of usage for non-subscription usage and these users appear to be those of unknown gender/sex.

### Bike Utilization

![Bike Utilization.png](https://github.com/AprilVilmin/bikesharing/blob/main/Bike%20Utilization.png)

#### This illustration show the number of times each bikes are used. The larger the circle/bubble the higher the utilization of the bike. This could be used to determine most popular pickup and drop off spots. As well as be used with other information, such as average ride duration per bike to determine which bikes are more likely to be in need of repair.

### Bike Repairs

![Bike Repairs.png](https://github.com/AprilVilmin/bikesharing/blob/main/Bike%20Repairs.png)

#### This treemap shows usage per bikeid. The darker the color the more riders have ridden the bike. Therefore it is thought the bike is more likely in need of repairs. 


## Summary 
This data that can be gathered from the above graphs provides a good foundation or introduction into the Citi Bike data. It provides information about a project similar to the one that is being proposed to the one in Des Moines. It shows who the target population should be, when to expect peaks and valleys throughout the day and addresses repairs. But as someone who works with data I have lingering questions. For example I donâ€™t think it goes far enough into the repair data. Just because certain bikes are checked out the most doesn't necessarily mean they are ridden the farthest and therefore may not be the most in need of repair. I would want to gather more data around repairs and do analysis on it as indicated above. I would also want to see illustrations of the data using other months. I would not want to base a company, especially one that is going to be operated outdoors in the Midwest, on only one month of data. I would ask for all the analysis to be redone on at least one month per quarter. Another concern I have with this data is that NYC and Des Moines are very different cities in tourism, citizens, layouts and infrastructure. I would want to see analysis that there are enough bike trails and places within the city of Des Moines that allow bike riding to see if this is even a viable business idea.
